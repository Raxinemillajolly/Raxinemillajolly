# Python Tip: Efficient List Concatenation

When working with lists in Python, efficient concatenation can significantly impact performance, especially with large datasets. While `+` operator and `append()` in a loop are common, they can be inefficient due to repeated memory allocations.

## Recommended Methods

### 1. `list.extend()`

For adding elements from one list to another, `list.extend()` is generally more efficient than `+` or `append()` in a loop because it extends the list in-place.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 2. List Comprehension (for creating a new list)

If you need to create a new list by concatenating multiple iterables, list comprehension can be a concise and efficient way.

```python
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [3, 4]
list3 = [5, 6]

combined_list = [item for sublist in [list1, list2, list3] for item in sublist]
print(combined_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 3. `sum()` with an empty list (for multiple lists)

For concatenating many small lists, `sum()` with an empty list as the starting point can be surprisingly efficient, though `itertools.chain` is often preferred for very large numbers of iterables.

```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
combined_list = sum(list_of_lists, [])
print(combined_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Avoid (for performance-critical code)

### `+` operator in a loop

```python
combined_list = []
for i in range(10000):
    combined_list = combined_list + [i] # Inefficient for large lists
```

Each `+` operation creates a new list, leading to `O(n^2)` complexity for `n` concatenations.

By choosing the right method, you can write more performant Python code for list concatenation.
