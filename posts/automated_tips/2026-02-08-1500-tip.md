# Python Tip: Virtual Environments

Always use **virtual environments** for your Python projects. They create isolated spaces for your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects and ensuring reproducibility. Tools like `venv` (built-in) or `conda` (for data science) are excellent choices. To create a `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv my_project_env
source my_project_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This practice keeps your global Python installation clean and your project dependencies manageable.
