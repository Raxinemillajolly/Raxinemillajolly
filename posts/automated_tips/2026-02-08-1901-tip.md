# Python Tip: Virtual Environments

Always use **virtual environments** for your Python projects. They isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts and ensuring reproducibility. Tools like `venv` (built-in) or `conda` (for data science) are excellent choices.

```bash
python3 -m venv myproject_env
source myproject_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```

This practice keeps your global Python environment clean and your projects manageable.
