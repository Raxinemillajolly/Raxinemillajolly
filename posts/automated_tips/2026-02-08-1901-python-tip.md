## Efficient List Comprehensions in Python

List comprehensions provide a concise and efficient way to create lists in Python. They are often more readable and faster than traditional `for` loops, especially for simple transformations and filtering operations.

**Tip:** When working with large datasets or performance-critical applications, prefer list comprehensions over explicit `for` loops. This is because list comprehensions are optimized at the C level in Python, leading to faster execution times.

### Example:

**Using a `for` loop:**

```python
squares = []
for i in range(1000000):
    squares.append(i * i)
```

**Using a list comprehension:**

```python
squares = [i * i for i in range(1000000)]
```

Benchmarking often shows that the list comprehension version can be significantly faster, sometimes by a factor of two or more, depending on the complexity of the operation and the size of the list.
