# Python Tip: Virtual Environments for Project Isolation

When working on multiple Python projects, it's crucial to maintain isolated environments to prevent dependency conflicts. Python's `venv` module allows you to create lightweight virtual environments, ensuring each project has its own set of dependencies without interfering with others.

## How to Use `venv`

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv my_project_env
    ```

2.  **Activate the environment:**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source my_project_env/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows (Command Prompt):
        ```bash
        my_project_env\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   On Windows (PowerShell):
        ```bash
        my_project_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```

4.  **Deactivate the environment:**
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

Using virtual environments is a best practice that leads to cleaner project management and avoids the dreaded "It works on my machine!" syndrome.
