# Technical Tip: Efficient Data Filtering with Pandas `.query()`

When working with large datasets in **Python** using **Pandas**, the `.query()` method can be significantly more readable and sometimes faster than traditional boolean indexing.

### Why use `.query()`?
1. **Readability**: It uses a string-based syntax that resembles SQL.
2. **Performance**: For large DataFrames, it can be faster as it uses `numexpr` under the hood.
3. **Cleanliness**: It avoids the repetitive `df[df['column'] > value]` syntax.

### Example:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Traditional way
filtered_df = df[(df['age'] > 25) & (df['city'] == 'New York')]

# Using .query()
filtered_df = df.query("age > 25 and city == 'New York'")
```

> **Note**: You can also reference local variables using the `@` symbol, like `df.query("age > @min_age")`.
